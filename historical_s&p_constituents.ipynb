    "Both researchers and practitioners (e.g., analysts) regularly use (current or historical) constituent lists of the S&P stock market indices, of which the S&P 500 index is the most important. As stated on Wikipedia, this index, maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, (at the moment of writing this notebook) comprises 505 common stocks issued by 500 large-cap companies and traded on American stock exchanges (including the 30 companies that compose the Dow Jones Industrial Average), and covers about 80 percent of the American equity market by capitalization. Until recently, it was possible to obtain detailed information on individual companies as they moved in and out of the constituent lists over the years from the (Capital IQ) Compustat databases. Unfortunately, this is no longer possible, since the company behind the S&P indices has decided to withdraw their constituent data from these databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia provides (some of) this information, however. That is, on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies, you can find two tables with information about the constituents of the S&P 500 index: (a) \"S&P 500 component stocks\", and (b) \"Selected changes to the list of S&P 500 components\". Similarly, on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_400_companies, you can find similar information for the constituents of the S&P (MidCap) 400 index, and on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_600_companies, for the constituents of the S&P (SmallCap) 600 index, although the information about the \"changes to the list of S&P 600 components\" is rather limited in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown below, the contents of the tables on these websites can relatively easily be scraped using pandas' `read_html()` method. On the website concerning the S&P 500 index, the first table provides a list of its current constituents, whereas the second table can be used to adapt this list if you want the list of the constituents at another (historical) point in time. On the websites concerning the S&P 400 and S&P 600 lists, you can find similar tables, but be aware that the column names and/or the order of the tables differs slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I first provide code that can be used to obtain a list of the tickers of the constituents of the S&P 500 index, and to write that list of tickers to a CSV file (but as .txt file). The code asks the user to input the date (format: YYYY-MM-DD) for which he/she would like to obtain the list, and automatically corrects for possible errors that *may* occur when there are firms that have moved in *and* out of the list since the requested date. Next, I provide code to do the same for the S&P 400 and S&P 600 indices. Finally, I provide code that combines the three lists, thereby generating the constituent list of the S&P 1500 index.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common use of these kinds of lists is to obtain data on the companies that are included in the list from the WRDS (Wharton Research Data Services) databases, such as the (Capital IQ) Compustat databases. When gathering data from these databases, you can upload this list in the databases and collect the requested data for all companies that are included in the list. For this purpose, you need a plain text (.txt) file having one code (in this case: ticker) per line, however. To obtain such a file, you can use pandas' `to_csv()` method."
